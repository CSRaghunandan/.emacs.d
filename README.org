* Rag .emacs.d
My emacs config.
** Notes
- Work in progress and is subject to frequent changes.
- Ivy as the preferred completion frontend for emacs.
- Very minimal theme with no toolbar, no scrollbars, no line numbers and use zenburn theme.
- Tested to work with emacs 25.1-1 and master build on macOS Sierra and linux.

** Key points
- =use-package= for faster load times and loading packages only when necessary.
- Certain packages will only work if you have the associated applications installed
  - =ripgrep=
  - =git=
  - =aspell=
  - =racer=
  - =jedi=
  - =LanguageTools=
  - =coreutils= (only if youâ€™re on macOS. Needed by =dired=)

* Feedback
Open to any feedback, corrections.
Thanks :)
