* Rag .emacs.d
My emacs config.
** Notes
- Work in progress and is subject to frequent changes.
- Ivy as the preferred completion frontend for emacs.
- Very minimal theme with no toolbar, no scrollbars, no line numbers and use zenburn theme.
- Tested to work with emacs 26.1 stable and 27.0.50 master on macOS Sierra and linux.

** Key points
- =use-package= for faster load times and loading packages only when necessary.
- Certain packages will only work if you have the associated applications installed
  - =ripgrep= -> as an alternative for grep and to grep entire project
  - =hunspell= -> for spellcheck
  - =LanguageTools= -> check for grammar mistakes
  - =coreutils= -> only if youâ€™re on macOS. Needed by =dired=
  - =fortune= -> for getting a random quote in *scratch* buffer
- I use Iosevka font which can be downloaded [[https://github.com/be5invis/Iosevka/releases/download/v2.2.0/iosevka-ss08-2.2.0.zip][here]]

* Feedback
Open to any feedback, corrections.
