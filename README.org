* Rag .emacs.d
My emacs config.
** Notes
- Work in progress and is subject to frequent changes.
- Ivy as the preferred completion frontend for emacs.
- Very minimal theme with no toolbar, no scrollbars, no line numbers and use zenburn theme.
- Tested to work with emacs 26.1 stable and 27.0.50 master on macOS Sierra and linux.

** Key points
- =use-package= for faster load times and loading packages only when necessary.
- Certain packages will only work if you have the associated applications installed
  - =ripgrep= -> as an alternative for grep and to grep entire project
  - =hunspell= -> for spellcheck
  - =LanguageTools= -> check for grammar mistakes
  - =coreutils= -> only if youâ€™re on macOS. Needed by =dired=
  - =fortune= -> for getting a random quote in *scratch* buffer
- Install a custom built =Iosevka= font from [[https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs/files/2162978/fonts.tar.gz][here]]
- If you are using built from master/trunk, use the =develop= branch for
  [[https://github.com/dieggsy/eterm-256color/blob/devel/eterm-256color.el][eterm-256color.el]] otherwise you will run into errors when invoking =multi-term=

Open to any feedback, corrections.
