Here is my emacs config.
** A few notes to consider
- This is a work in progress and is subject to frequent changes.
- After playing around with helm for a month, I switched to a combination of Ivy + Swiper + Counsel largely due to how snappy and consistent they feel.
  If you want to use helm, comment out the following lines in =init.el= :-
  - =(require 'setup-ivy)=
  - =(require 'setup-counsel)=
  - =(require 'setup-swiper)=
  And after, add this line to =init.el= :- =(require 'setup-helm)=
- I run a very minimal theme with no toolbar, no scrollbars, no line numbers(I found emacs solution for line numbers to be lackluster, especially for handling long lines).
  I use ~PragmataPro~ as the preferred font and zenburn theme. These are all tuned for my preference, feel free to change them to your liking.

* Feedback
Open to any feedback, corrections.
Thanks :)
