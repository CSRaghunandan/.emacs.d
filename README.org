* Rag .emacs.d
My emacs config.
** Notes
- This is a work in progress and is subject to frequent changes.
- I prefer to use `ivy` as the completion frontend for emacs.
  If you want to use helm, add this line to =init.el= :- =(require 'setup-helm)=
- I run a very minimal theme with no toolbar, no scrollbars, no line numbers and use zenburn theme.
- Tested to work with emacs 25.1.1 on macOS Sierra.

** Key points
- =use-package= for faster load times and loading packages only when necessary.
- Certain packages will only work if you have the associated applications installed
  - =ripgrep=
  - =git=
  - =aspell=
  - =racer=
  - =jedi=
  - =LanguageTools=
  - =coreutils= (only if youâ€™re on macOS. Needed by `dired`]

* Feedback
Open to any feedback, corrections.
Thanks :)
