This function is equivalent to `list-packages', followed by a

the user isn't asked to confirm deletion of packages.
The NO-FETCH prefix argument is passed to `list-packages'.  It
prevents re-download of information about new versions.  It does
not prevent downloading the actual packages (obviously)."
